# Supervised Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn.

This is meant as an introduction to the topic and it will not cover all aspects of Scikit-Learn and Supervised Machine Learning.


## TODOs

- For the picture of hte KNN data points, include the dataset and draw it in realtime

- For the crossvalidation picture, label the internal folds, 'test' and 'train'

- for the Venn, show the intersection of where engineers spend their time

- clarify the target audience and what will and will not be covered, and what will the user get out of it.
